                <h3>Confusion Matrix</h3>
                This confusion matrix illustrates the performance of your
                classification model on the test dataset. - Wild category: 40
                images were correctly predicted as "Wild," while 7 were
                misclassified as "Domestic." - Domestic category: 19 images were
                correctly classified, but 9 were incorrectly identified as
                "Wild." The matrix helps identify patterns in model errors and
                evaluate precision, recall, and overall accuracy.

                <h3>Model Accuracy</h3>
                This plot shows how the accuracy of the model evolves during
                training: - The blue line (Train Accuracy) represents accuracy
                on the training dataset, steadily increasing, which shows the
                model is learning. - The orange line (Validation Accuracy)
                tracks the model's performance on unseen validation data. A
                steady rise in both lines reflects good model performance and
                suggests minimal overfitting.

                <h3>Model Loss</h3>
                This plot visualizes the reduction in error during training: -
                The blue line (Train Loss) shows a steady decrease, indicating
                improved performance as the model learns. - The orange line
                (Validation Loss) fluctuates but decreases overall, reflecting
                good generalization. A minimal gap between these lines suggests
                the model avoids significant overfitting.

                <h3>Filtering</h3>
                The "Original Image" represents the unprocessed visual input for
                classification. The "Filtered Image (Blue)" highlights features
                extracted by applying filters to the blue color channel.
                Filtering enhances important patterns like edges and textures
                for better model input. This step is crucial for understanding
                how the model perceives visual data for classification.
